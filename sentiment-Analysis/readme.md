Purpose: This script is designed to process and analyze multiple pieces of text using a pre-trained language model. It can handle several texts in a single input string, separated by a chosen delimiter (like a period or newline). Each text is analyzed individually, and the results are formatted for easy readability.

How It Works:

Input Text: The script accepts a string containing multiple texts separated by a delimiter (e.g., period, newline, semicolon).
Preprocessing: Each individual text is preprocessed before being passed to the model.
Tokenization: The preprocessed text is tokenized into the format required by the pre-trained model.
Model Inference: The model processes the tokenized input to produce output scores for each label or category.
Softmax Scoring: The raw scores from the model are converted into probabilities using the softmax function.
Ranking: The script ranks the labels or categories based on the scores, from highest to lowest.
Formatted Output: The results for each text are formatted into a string that lists the ranked labels along with their corresponding scores.
Customization:

Delimiter: You can specify the delimiter used to separate the texts in the input string.
Preprocessing: You can adjust the preprocessing function according to the needs of your specific application.
